#+title: 2 First Steps
* 2-1
Worked through examples.

* 2-2
(2^3) * 4
(2 * 3) + (4 * 5)
2 + (3 * (4^5))

* 2-3
#+begin_src haskell
func :: Int -> Int
func x = a ´div´ length xs where
      a = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
func 0
#+end_src


changed variable name to =n= since they are not allowed to begin with uppercase.

* 2-4
`last xs` could be defined in terms of:

drop (length xs - 1)
or
xs !! (length xs - 1)

* 2-5
`init xs` could be defined in terms of:

take (length xs - 1)
or
reverse (tail (reverse xs))
